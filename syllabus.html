Email is the best way to get in touch with me; I check it FREQUENTLY during the day.
####OFFICE HOURS: 
1:20 – 2:10 MTWF
<br>
<br>
Office hours are a time when I am guaranteeing I will be in my office and available for help. Please come and see me outside of
class if you need help. In addition to my office hours, group tutoring and private tutoring is available. The private tutors are from special academic services in Crandall Hall, contact Beth Niles at 871-2148.
####COURSE DESCRIPTION: 
This course develops the fundamental concepts of computer programming including conditional statements, loops, procedural programming, scope of variables, GUI programming, and objects.
Prerequisite: CSCI 156
####TEXTBOOK
<a href="http://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python/">Think Python, Allen B Downey</a>
<br>
Python 3 Object Oriented Programming, Dusty Phillips
####INSTRUCTOR EXPECTATIONS: 
We will have a fun semester learning about computing.
####GRADING POLICY:  
Your grade will be computed using the breakdown:
<br>
Tests                                40%
<br>
Programming Projects (Github)          35%
<br>
Final Project                    10%
<br>
Final Exam                      15%
<br>
Your letter grade in the course is assigned as follows:
<br>
A>93,A->90,B+>87,B>83,B->80,C+>77,C>73,C->70,D+>68, D >= 65, F < 65.
<br>
Typically the 65 is hard and fast: that means you shouldn’t count on a 64 as passing.
####HOMEWORK: 
Lots of programming assignments posted on Github.
####FLIPPED CLASSROOM MODEL:
This class uses a flipped classroom model. I have recorded lesson videos that are available on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChmjEZ4yhlRn68HCcx0PO_Q">YouTube</a>. You will watch those lesson videos, and in class I will assist you in working on projects related to the videos. The videos are short which makes it easy to watch them multiple times if necessary. The programming projects are posted on GitHub.
####GitHub
GitHub is a version control system that is widely used in the computing industry. A version control system is used to track versions of software as the software is updated. When used properly GitHub can be used to keep track of versions of your program and all updates, acting like a backup system and a failsafe system. If something goes wrong with an update you can easily revert to a previous version. For the small programming projects in this course we will likely not need that functionality, but programmers should be aware of systems like GitHub.

####LEARNING OUTCOMES: 
1. Students will learn how to design an object and when to use OOP.
2. Students will learn about inheritance.
3. Students will learn how to manage widgets in a window.
4. Students will learn how to associate actions with widgets.

####STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES:  
Alfred University is committed to upholding and maintaining all aspects of the Federal Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 
(ADA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. If you are a student with a disability and wish to request 
accommodations, please contact Dr. Elmore at the Office of Special Academic Services located in Crandall Hall, or call 
(607) 871-2148. Any information regarding your disability will remain confidential. Many accommodations require early planning, therefore requests for accommodations should be made as early as possible. Any requests for accommodations will be reviewed in a timely manner to determine their appropriateness to this setting.  Students who have been granted accommodations from Special Academic Services must present to me the appropriate documentation in writing in advance of the use of such accommodations.
####LETTERS OF RECOMMENDATION:
I am happy to write letters of recommendation for students as long as you have earned at least a B in my course. It would be 
really helpful if we have talked outside of class. I will also need a list of the activities you have participated in, and an 
e-mail with an address to send the letter to. You will also need to waive your rights to read the letter.
